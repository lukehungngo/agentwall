"""AnalysisContext — shared mutable state flowing through the analysis pipeline.

Each analyzer reads what it needs from ctx, may write intermediate results
for downstream analyzers, and returns findings. The depends_on metadata
on each analyzer declares which fields it expects to be populated.

WARNING: Analyzer ordering is load-bearing. The registry topologically sorts
by depends_on. Do not reorder or parallelize without verifying data dependencies.
